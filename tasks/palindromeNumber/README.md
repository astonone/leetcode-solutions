Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:</br>
Input: x = 121</br>
Output: true</br>
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.</br>

Example 2:</br>
Input: x = -121</br>
Output: false</br>
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.</br>

Example 3:</br>
Input: x = 10</br>
Output: false</br>
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.</br>

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
